This project predicts any stock that you choose using a LSTM recurrent neural network, 
you are able to adjust how long you want to look back at the stocks values. When predicting a 
stocks price you must first prepare the data by parsing, then train the model and finally
predict the the next days value. The larger the number that you put for the look back value
the more data the LSTM will have which will help with the accuracy of the result.
